# ðŸ§ª Quick Network Access Test

## Updated Server Details:
- **IP Address**: 172.17.36.118
- **New Port**: 3000 (changed from 8000)
- **URL**: http://172.17.36.118:3000

## Test Steps (in order):

### Step 1: Test on This PC 
```
âœ… Go to: http://localhost:3000
âœ… Should work normally
```

### Step 2: Test from Mobile Phone
```
ðŸ“± Connect phone to same WiFi
ðŸ“± Go to: http://172.17.36.118:3000
ðŸ“± If works â†’ Corporate PC restriction
ðŸ“± If fails â†’ Network/router issue
```

### Step 3: Test from Other PC
```
ðŸ’» Go to: http://172.17.36.118:3000
ðŸ’» If works â†’ Problem solved!
ðŸ’» If fails â†’ Try additional solutions below
```

## ðŸ”§ Additional Solutions for Corporate Networks:

### Option A: Create Phone Hotspot
```
1. Enable hotspot on your phone
2. Connect both PCs to phone's WiFi
3. Use app: http://[NEW_IP]:3000
```

### Option B: Try More Ports
```
Common unblocked ports: 3000, 5000, 9000, 8080
Edit app.py: uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)
```

### Option C: Use Same PC Multiple Windows
```
Window 1: http://localhost:3000
Window 2: http://127.0.0.1:3000  
Window 3: Incognito mode
```

### Option D: Ask IT Department
```
Request: "Please allow port 3000 for internal app testing"
Alternative: "Allow Python.exe network access"
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Most Likely to Work:
1. **Mobile phone test** (bypasses PC restrictions)
2. **Phone hotspot method** (creates new network)
3. **Port 5000 or 9000** (less restricted)

Try these in order and let me know which works!
